Computer science is the study of how computers work and how we can make them do useful tasks. People in this field write programs, or instructions, that tell the computer what to do. These programs are written in special languages, like Python or Java. Computers use these programs to solve problems, play games, or help people find information. In a computer, there is a brain called the processor that follows the instructions in the program. Every time we use a computer, we are using the work of computer scientists to make things easier and faster.
