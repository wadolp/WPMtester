The sky was a strange shade of green; the clouds churned in the distance, ominous and swirling. Sarah stared at the horizon, feeling a chill creep up her spine. "Is this it?" she whispered, her heart racing. "Is this the one we've been warned about?" The wind picked up suddenly, bending the trees almost in half. It howled, sending debris flying through the air. "Why does it always feel like the world is about to break when these storms hit?" she thought, her hands trembling. Then, a deafening roar cut through the noiseâ€”was it the tornado? Or just the wind? Her pulse quickened, and she grabbed her phone. "I need to get inside, now!" she shouted, as the sky darkened even more.
