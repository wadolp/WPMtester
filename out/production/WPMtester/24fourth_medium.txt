As the storm rolled in, dark clouds gathered quickly over the hills. The wind picked up, rustling the trees and sending leaves swirling through the air. People on the street hurried to find shelter, pulling up hoods and opening umbrellas as the first drops began to fall. Lightning flashed in the distance; the low rumble of thunder followed soon after. Despite the sudden shift in weather, there was something peaceful about the rain. It washed over the city, clearing the dust from rooftops and sidewalks, leaving behind a sense of calm after the rush.
