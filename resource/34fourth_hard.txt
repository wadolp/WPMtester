Java was created in 1991 by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems; initially, it was designed for interactive television. However, the project quickly evolved as the team realized the potential of a portable, platform-independent programming language. "What if we could create software that could run anywhere, without modification?" Gosling wondered, and thus, Java was born.
