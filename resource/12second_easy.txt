Lena went to the store to buy fruit. She picked red apples, yellow bananas, and sweet grapes. She smiled as she placed them in her basket. On the way home, she saw a small cat sitting by a tree. The cat looked hungry, so Lena gave it a piece of bread. The cat meowed and followed her. When she got home, she poured a bowl of milk and set it down. The cat drank it happily. From that day on, the cat stayed near her door. Lena named it Lucky and gave it food every day.
