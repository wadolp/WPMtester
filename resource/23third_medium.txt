The city pulsed with sound and motion. Cars wove through crowded streets, their horns blaring in bursts of impatience, while people hurried along sidewalks, talking into phones or balancing heavy bags. Street performers filled the corners with music, their tunes blending into the rhythm of the day. From nearby restaurants, the scent of spices and grilled food drifted through the open windows, tempting passersby. Amid the noise and bustle, a small park offered a brief escape. Children laughed as they ran across the grass, while elderly readers turned pages slowly on sun-warmed benches. Even in the heart of the chaos, moments of stillness found their place.
