Anna loves to bake. She wakes up early, puts on her apron, and gets started. First, she mixes flour, sugar, and eggs in a big bowl. Then she adds butter and stirs until the mix is smooth. She pours it into a pan and places it in the oven. As the cake bakes, the smell fills the kitchen. When it’s done, she lets it cool before adding frosting. Her friends come over to try it. They all smile after the first bite. “This is so good!” they say. Anna feels proud. She knows she wants to bake again tomorrow.
