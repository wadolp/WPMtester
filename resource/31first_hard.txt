It’s about learning how to think—how to read deeper.” He frowned. “Can’t we do that with something modern? Something that matters?” “Relevance isn’t always immediate,” she replied. “Sometimes, it’s the process that shapes you.” Marcus was quiet for a moment. “You sound like the teacher.” She smiled. “Maybe. Or maybe I just don’t want to fight every assignment.” He gave a half-laugh. “Still feels pointless.” “Pointless doesn’t mean worthless,” she said, already turning back to her notes.
