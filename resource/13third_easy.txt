Tom and his sister went to the beach. They built a big sandcastle with towers and a gate. The waves crashed nearby, but their castle stayed strong. After building, they ran into the water to cool off. It was cold at first, but soon they were laughing and splashing. Their mom called them for lunch. They ate sandwiches and drank juice under a big umbrella. Seagulls flew above, looking for crumbs. As the sun began to set, they packed their things and went home, tired but happy.
